INTRODUCTION
------------
photoprep is a BASH script that relies on ImageMagick to resize and watermark 
images.

First, it creates a new directory. The name of the new directory is the width of the output images (by default this is 1200).

For each image in the present working directory, the script will:

1. Resize the photo to a specified width (by default 1200 px) and output to 
   PNG format (in the new directory).

2. Resize the logo to 6% of the width of the photo and output to PNG format (in
   the new directory). Exception: The logo won't be resized if it is already 
   less than or equal to 6% of the photo width.

3. Composite the resized logo over the resized photo, and output to JPEG 
   format, optimized at 92% (in the new directory).

4. Remove the two PNG files.



USAGE
-----

photoprep [-l <LOGO_FILE>] [-e <EXTENSION_OF_INPUT_FILES>] [-s <OUTPUT_WIDTH>]

If no logo file is provided, the image will not be watermarked.

If no extension is specified, by default, the script will look for files that
end in the ".jpg" extension.

If no output width is provided, by default, the script will output to JPEG
files that are 1200 px in width.
